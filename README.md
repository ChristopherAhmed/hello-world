# hello-world
My first repository (learning how to do this so I can be a better R-progamer at work)

As a practice project I think I am going to use the NY-times COVID-19 county level dataset, and the R Rayshader pacakge to create a 3-d visualization for WA state.

Here's are some Rayshader example links:
