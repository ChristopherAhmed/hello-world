# hello-world
My first repository (learning how to do this so I can be a better R-progamer at work)

As a practice project I think I am going to use the NY-times COVID-19 county level dataset, and then using rayshader and a state county shapefiles, I will create a 3-d GIFF of each state where the camera rotates around each state map showing how cases per county has changed over time (or it may just be a snapshot in time). 

Here's are some Rayshader example links:
